# Bash scripts

## get_general_info.bash

The script collects basic information about the file being analysed. The path (as argument) to the file is required.

**Usage**:

```bash
bash get_info.bash /path/to/the/file
```

The script checks for directories (artifacts, malicious, output) in the folder where the file is located. All output is stored in the **output** directory.
